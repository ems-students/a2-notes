# Exeter Mathematics School A2 Notes

Notes on a-level computing, maths, further maths and physics as taught at Exeter Mathematics School. Not everything in these notes is part of the syllabus; related but off-piste things are included. We'll probably accept pull requests.

Maths and further maths are Edexcel; computing is AQA and physics is WJEC.
