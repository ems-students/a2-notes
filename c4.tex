\section{Parametric Curves}

Parametric curves occur when \(x\) and \(y\) are defined in terms of a parameter, a parameter being a value that is the same in both the functions for \(x\) and for \(y\). In a parametric curve \(C\) with parameter \(t\);

\[C:x=f(t),y=g(t)\]

\noindent One differentiates a parametric eqution using the chain rule. If we were to differentiate \(y\) with respect to \(x\) by the chain rule, we would find

\[\frac{\textrm{d}y}{\textrm{d}x}=\frac{\textrm{d}y}{\textrm{d}t}\frac{\textrm{d}t}{\textrm{d}x}=\frac{f'(t)}{g'(t)}\]

\noindent Integration of parametric curves is done by integrating with respect to \(t\). If one has to integrate with respect to something else, one can tranform it hence;

\[\int_{f(t)=a}^{b}g(t)\textrm{d}f(t)=\int_{t=f^{-1}(a)}^{b}g(t)f'(t)\textrm{d}t\]

\noindent This is then isomorphic to integration of non-parametric curves.

\section{Implicit Differentiation}

\[\frac{\textrm{d}}{\textrm{d}x}xy=\frac{\textrm{d}y}{\textrm{d}x}x+y\]
\[\frac{\textrm{d}}{\textrm{d}x}y^n=\frac{\textrm{d}y}{\textrm{d}x}ny^{n-1}\]

\section{Forming Differential Equations}

Differential equations describe scenarios in which;

\[\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\propto y\]

\noindent Newton's law of cooling states that the rate of loss of temperature $-\frac{\partial\theta}{\partial t}$ is proportional to the the difference between the temperature $\theta$ of the body and the temperature $\theta_0$ of its surroundings;

\[\frac{\partial\theta}{\partial t}=-k(\theta-\theta_0)\]
